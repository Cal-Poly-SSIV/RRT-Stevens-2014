%% MPC Supervisory Control of a Two Stage Thermo-Mechanical Pulping Process

%%
% This demo illustrates control of a thermo-mechanical pulping (TMP) 
% application using MPC.

%% Plant Description
% The following diagram shows a typical process arrangement for a two 
% stage TMP operation. Two pressured refiners operate in sequence to
% produce a mechanical pulp suitable for making newsprint.
%
% A primary objective of controlling the TMP plant is to regulate the
% energy applied to the pulp by the electric motors which drive each
% refiner to derive pulp with good physical properties without incurring 
% excess energy costs. 
%
% A secondary control objective is to regulate the ratio of dry mass flow
% rate to overall mass flow rate (known as consistency) measured at the
% outlet of each refiner. 
% 
% In practice these objectives amount to regulating the primary and
% secondary refiner motor loads and the primary and secondary refiner
% constancies subject to the following output constraints: 
%
% (1) Power on each refiner must be less than maximum rated values rated. 
%
% (2) Maintain the vibration level on the two refiners below a critical
% level defined to prevent refiner plate clash.
%
% (3) Limits on measured consistency to prevent blow line plugging and
% fiber damage. 
%
% Manipulated variables comprise:
%
% * set points to the two gap controllers regulating the distance between the refiner plates 
% * the dilution flow rates to the two refiners
% * the rpm of the screw feeder
%
% Physical limits are also imposed on each of these inputs.

%%
% The following Simulink(R) model represents a TMP plant and an MPC Controller
% designed for the control objectives described above. The model can be
% opened with:
open_system('TMPdemo')

%%
% The MPC controller is represented by an MPC object in the workspace. It 
% can be viewed at the command line as follows:
load MPCtmpdemo;
MPC1

%%
% The controller was built by obtaining a linear plant model
% from the non-linear TMP Simulink(R) model using the MPC GUI (accessible from
% the "Design..." button on the MPC Controller mask) and then tuning the
% MPC controller from within the MPC GUI. 

%% Tuning the Controller Using the MPC GUI
% The controller design parameters can be viewed by opening the MPC GUI
% from the MPC mask then hitting the "Design..." button. The following window
% will open:
%
% <<mpcgui1.jpg>>
%
% Controller weights can be viewed by selecting the controller node representing
% MPC1 and then selecting the "Weights" tab:
%
% <<mpcgui2.jpg>>
%
% The effect of design changes can be observed in the GUI by clicking on the
% "Scenarios" node to create a new Simulation scenario. The following shows
% the setup for Simulating a setpoint change on the primary refiner motor
% load from 8 to 9 MW without model mismatch. The results are displayed in
% separate figure windows: 
%
% <<mpcgui3.jpg>>
%
% <<idealIn.png>>
%
% <<idealOut.png>>
%

%% Simulating the Design in Simulink(R)
% The controller can be tested on the non-linear plant by running the
% simulation in Simulink(R). Any design changes made in the MPC GUI will
% automatically be tracked by the MPC mask, so there is no need to export
% the design back to the workspace. The output of the 3 scopes show 
% the response to an initial set point of:
%
% * Primary consistency 0.4
% * Primary motor load 8.5 MW
% * secondary consistency 0.3
% * secondary motor load of 6 MW
